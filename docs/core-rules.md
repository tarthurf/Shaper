# Shaper Alpha Playtest v0.2

## Introduction

### What is Shaper?
Shaper is a tabletop role playing game (TTRPG).

### Goal
The goal of Shaper is to be a themeless, classless, and raceless TTRPG that can be played in any setting with rule sets that can be added or removed seamlessly. But, above all, Shaper is meant to be easy to learn, simple to play, and highly modular.

### Objective
This is a playtest. As such, this handbook does not represent the full scope of Shaper. Things are unbalanced and untested. Terms, rules and components are subject to change. This is a work in progress.

#### Here are the current rulesets presented in this handbook:
- Basic Actor Creation
- Leveling
- Abilities
- The Battlefield
- Movement and Measuring Distance
- Actor Placement and Zones
- Combat System
- Rolling Dice
- Attacking and Evasion
- Action Economy

Think of these rulesets for any feedback you may have.


## Getting Started

### What do I need to start playing Shaper?
At a minimum you will need:
- An Actor Creation Sheet for each player
- At least one 6-sided die, but the more you have the better off you will be
- Scratch paper

### It is recommended to have:
- At least three 6-sided dice for each player and the game master
- Tokens or figurines to track movement on the Battlefield
- A whiteboard or playmat to display the Battlefield


## Setup

### Creating Your Actor
Fill out your Actor Creation Sheets:
- Write down a name for your actor in the Actor Name field and write your name in the Player Name field if you would like.
- Start at level 1. Put 1 in the LVL field.
- Actors gain 1 Ability Point at level 1. Distribute that point in Vigor, Finesse, or Mentality.
- It is recommended to have players start with a balanced selection of abilities
- Write down your actor’s total health points in the Total HP field.
- Actors start with 10 HP.
- Add any additional health gained from Vigor.
- Write down your total Skill Points in the Total SP field.
- Actors have 1 SP at level 1.
- Actors have 1 SP Regen at level 1.
- Fill out your Evasion.
- Base Evasion for all Actors is 3d6+0
- Add any additional Evasion bonuses from Finesse
- Pick your equipment:
- Choose two weapons or one weapon and one shield from the equipment list.
- If using a range weapon select ammo for that weapon as well.
- Choose your armor. Write down that armor’s Defense in the Defense field.
- You may choose to wear no armor as well.
- Pick a skill from the Skills List. Write the name and description on the Actor Skills Sheet and mark that you have 1 point in that skill under the description field.
- Skills in the Vigor, Finesse, or Mentality categories require 1 Ability Point in that Ability.
- General Skills have no requirements.

## Draw the Battlefield
On a piece of paper or other drawing medium, draw a 5x5 grid, with each Zone (grid square) being large enough to fit several (around 5) tokens or figurines inside.

You are now ready to play.


## How to Play

In its current state, Shaper only supports the combat portion of a TTRPG.

### Overview
Gameplay can be broken down into several steps:
-Determine Actor turn order
-Place Actor tokens or figurines on the Battlefield
-Begin first round of combat
-A round is complete when all Actors have completed their turn
-Continue until combat is resolved

This is an oversimplification of the flow of combat. Let’s break down each step starting with the Battlefield, since it is the first thing Players will interact with.


## The Battlefield

### Overview
The Battlefield is a representation of a two dimensional space that is used to track Actor positions and determine distances between two points.

### Zones
A Zone is a grid square of the overall Battlefield grid. The Battlefield can have any number of Zones in any configuration. For this playtest, we will start out with a 5x5 grid to represent our Battlefield.

Zones represent areas of action on the battlefield. As such, any number of Actors (that makes sense) can reside in the same zone. 

### Distance
Unlike many TTRPGs, Shaper does not measure distance by grids or specific measurement tools. Distance between two points (or Zones) is measured by generic distances, based on how many zones must be moved through to get from point A to point B.

The distance from one zone into the next is considered a Short distance. Another way to visualize this is to think of the movement of a King on a chess board. It can move one square in any direction, or on Short distance in any direction. 

Distances beyond Short are incremental. Shaper uses generic terms for measured distances. These terms and their equivalent distance are as follows:
# Make a table for this
Short - 1 Short distance
Medium - 2 Short distances
Long - 3 Short distances OR 1 Medium distance and 1 Short distance
Long + 1 - 4 Short distances OR 1 Long distance and 1 Short distance

Any distance beyond Long is appended with a “+“ and the number of Short distances beyond Long distance. For instance: Long +2 (1 Long distance and 2 Short distances), Long + 3 ( 1 Long Distance and 3 Short distances OR 2 Long distances), etc.

#### Diagonal Distance
Measuring diagonal movement can be slightly tricky in a regular grid. Here is the common rule of movement in Shaper: Distance is measured from one zone to another by counting each zone in between while making 0 or 1 diagonal movements.



Proper Diagonal Movement



Improper Diagonal Movement


#### Close and Melee Range
Close and Melee range work a little differently than the above example. Close and Melee range measure distance INSIDE of a Zone. Let's imagine two actors wielding longswords. If they are in the same zone and close enough to hit each other with their longswords, they are in Melee range. If they are in the same zone and NOT close enough to hit each other, they are at Close range.





## Rolling Dice

### The Basic Roll
The basic roll is used to determine success or failure of an action. A basic roll is 3d6+0. The higher the value, the more likely your action will be successful. It is possible to gain bonuses or even additional dice on a Basic Roll.

Attacking and Evasion both use basic rolls and take in any modifiers from abilities or skills that may be applicable.



#### Automatic Success and Failure
When you make a Basic Roll, if you roll all 6’s you automatically succeed at whatever action you are attempting. Alternatively, if you roll all 1’s you automatically fail whatever action you are attempting.

#### Other types of rolling
You will roll dice for other things, most commonly, Damage and Defense. You will still use 6-sided dice for these rolls. The amount of dice rolled and bonuses applied vary.

#### Edge and Pressured
Depending on certain situations, Actors may get Edge or Pressured on some of their Basic Rolls. When rolling with Edge, take your highest rolled die, and make it a 6. When rolling with Pressured, take your lowest rolled die and make it a 1. If you roll a Automatic Success with Edge, your action still succeeds and vice versa if rolling a Critical Failure while Pressured.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage
Depending on certain situations, Actors may get advantage or disadvantage on some of their Basic Rolls. When rolling with Advantage, take your lowest rolled die, and make it a 6. When rolling with Disadvantage, take your highest rolled die and make it a 1. If you roll a Automatic Success while Disadvantaged, your action still succeeds and vice versa if rolling a Critical Failure while disadvantaged.


## Actions in Combat

### Action Economy
Actors have a certain number of Actions they can use during their turn. Every turn, an Actor has 3 Major Actions, 1 Minor Action, and 1 Free Action. Actions cannot be used outside of an Actor’s turn. If a Player wishes to end their turn without using all available actions, they may do so but will waste any unused actions.

#### Major Action
Major Actions are used for the most common actions an Actor will take on their turn. Some uses for Major Actions are:
- Attacking an Actor
- Moving 1 Short distance
- Trigger a skill
- Cast a spell
- Picking up an item within Close Distance
- Switching Weapons
- Take a Minor Action (when no Minor Action is available)

This list does not cover all Major Actions.

#### Minor Actions
Minor Actions are generally considered to be less impactful than Major Actions. Some uses for Minor Actions are:
- Drawing or sheathing a weapon or a shield
- Reloading or readying heavy weapons
- Raising a Shield
- Engaging or Disengaging in Melee combat
- Switch weapon grip
- Picking up an item within Melee Distance
- Take a Free Action (when no Free Action is available)

This list does not cover all Minor Actions.

#### Free Actions
Free actions are actions that take almost no effort to do once in a turn. Some uses for Free Actions are:
- Saying something
- Dropping an item held in your hand

This list does not cover all Free Actions.


## Attacking and Evasion

### Attacking
To attack an Actor during your turn you must be within range and have a Major Action available. Making an attack is not the same as dealing damage. An attack determines if you hit your target. Damage is dealt if your attack hits.

An attack is based on a Basic Roll. There are many ways to add bonuses to your attacks.

### Evasion
Evasion is used to determine whether or not you are hit by another Actor’s attack. Evasion is based on a Basic roll. There are many ways to add bonuses to your Evasion.

Evasion does not have any other requirements than your Actor being targeted by an attack.

#### Attack vs. Evasion
When an Actor makes an attack against another Actor, they roll a Basic roll for their attack and apply any bonuses or penalties. The targeted Actor rolls a Basic Roll for their Evasion and applies any bonuses or penalties. In order for an attack to hit, the attack roll total must be EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN the targets Evasion roll total. If you hit, you deal damage with that attack. If you miss, you do no damage to that Actor for that attack.

Example: “You wish to attack an Actor with your longsword. You are within Melee range and have an available Major Action to spend for the attack. You have 1 point in vigor which gives a bonus of +1 to attacks at Melee range. You roll a basic roll which comes out to 13 (5 + 5 + 3) and add you +1 bonus for a total attack roll of 14 (5 + 3 + 3 + 1). The targeted Actor rolls a Basic Roll for their Evasion against this attack. They roll an 11 (6 + 2 + 3) and apply no bonuses or penalties. Your attack roll total (14) is higher than the targeted Actor’s Evasion roll total (11). Your attack hits that actor.”

Remember that if an attack roll and evasion roll are equal (for instance, attack of 12 and Evasion of 12) the attack still hits. This is because attacking costs an action and Evasion is always free.

### Critical Threshold
If an attack roll total is 9 or more than an Evasion roll total, the attack deals critical damage. When you score a Critical roll an additional d6 for damage. If multiple targets are affected by an attack, only roll critical damage against the targets that were past the critical threshold (difference of 9 or more between rolls)

### Armor and Defense
Actors will usually be wearing armor in combat. Armor provides Defense against damage. If an Actor is hit with an attack while wearing armor, they roll their Armor’s Defense. The damage dealt from an attack is reduced by the total of your armor roll. Do this for every attack that hits an Actor.

Example: “You are attacked by an Actor wielding a longsword. Their attack roll total is 12 and your Evasion total is 12 which means you are hit with the attack (remember, an Evasion roll must be GREATER THAN the attacking Actor’s attack roll). A longsword lists its attack Damage as 1d6+3. They roll a 2 and add 3 damage to the attack for a total of 5 (2 + 3). Your armor lists its Defense as 1d6. You roll a 4 and add no bonuses. The attack damage is reduced by 4 by your armor and you take 1 damage (5 - 4).”

### Pierce and Magic vs. Defense
Some weapons may add Pierce to an attack’s damage. Pierce reduces the effectiveness of armor by the Pierce value. In the example above, if the attack damage had Pierce 2, it would have reduced the targeted Actor’s defense roll from 4 to 2 (4-2) letting the attack deal more damage (3 instead of 1). Pierce does NOT do additional damage, even if the defense roll was less than your attack’s Pierce. 

Damage from magic sources or Spells reduce the effectiveness of Armor by half, rounded down.

Example: “You are hit with a spell that deals 7 damage. You roll a 7 for your defense. Your defense is reduced by half (3.5) and rounded down to a whole number (3). You take 4 damage (7 - 3) from the spell.”


## Engagements and Melee Combat

### Engaging and Disengaging
In order for Actors to be in Melee range they must be Engaged. 

In order to begin an Engagement, two Actor’s must be in the same Zone and one Actor must use a Minor Action to Engage with the other Actor. Once an Actor has Engaged another, they are both considered in an engagement together and are within Melee range. Multiple Actors may be in the same Engagement.

In order to leave an Engagement, an Actor must use a Minor Action to Disengage. They are then no longer engaged and are no longer in Melee range of the Engagement. Actors remain in their current Zone after Disengaging.

Example: “You are in the same zone (close range) as another Actor during their turn. They wish to begin an engagement and use a Minor Action to Engage with you. That Actor makes a series of Melee attacks against you. Another Actor decides they want to be in the Engagement, moves to the same zone and uses their Minor Action to Engage. That Actor makes a series of attacks against you. It is now your turn. You wish to leave the Engagement and use your minor action to disengage. You then use a Major Action to move 1 Short distance away from your current zone.”


## Skills

### What are Skills?
Skills define what your Actor can do in combat. Skills are gained by leveling. Actors gain 1 Skill at level 1 and every 1 level after. You may level a skill up to 4 times. You can use a Skill once per round per level in that skill (a round ends at the beginning of your turn).

### How do Skills work?
Skills are generally triggered based on certain conditions. Once that skill is triggered, apply the effects of the Skill in whichever way it is described. Skills generally scale in power based on the Ability or Abilities they are tied to. For instance, the higher your Vigor the stronger your vigor skills are.

### How do you use skills?
Skills require a Major Action or a Skill Point (SP) in order to use them. Some skills can be used outside of your turn, others can only be used during your turn.

### What is a Skill Trigger?
A Skill Trigger is a specific action, condition, or situation that allows a Skill to be used.

### What is SP?
SP is a resource that allows you to use Skills during your turn without using a Major Action. It also allows you to use Skills outside of your turn.

SP is a pool of points that regenerates a specific rate. At level 1 you have a total SP of 1 in your SP pool. When you trigger a Skill, you can use 1 SP from your SP pool instead of a Major Action. At the beginning of your turn, you add a number of SP points equal to your SP regen to your Current SP. Your Current SP can not be more than your Total SP.

### Skill Triggers
Skills can have multiple Triggers. Each skill has at least one Primary Trigger and may have one or more Secondary Triggers. 
Primary Triggers are as follows:
- On Attack - Skill can be used when declaring an attack. The skill must be used before an attack roll has been made.
- On Hit - Skill can be used when you are Hit by an attack.
- On Critical - Skill can be used when you have scored a Critical hit.
- On Evade - Skill can be used when you Evade an attack.
- Anytime - Skill can be used at any time with regard to the Skill’s limitations, if any.
- Targeted - Skill can be used when an attack is declared against you. The Skill must be used before an attack roll has been made.
- Reaction - Catch all for any other scenarios.

Secondary Triggers will add more specificity to when the Skill can be used:
- Melee - Melee attack must be involved to Trigger Skill.
- Spell - Must be cast as a spell or added onto a casted spell.
- Vigor|Finesse|Mentality - Must gain benefits from a specific ability.
- Block - Can only be used with a shield raised.

A Skills Triggers will be listed as such:

SKILL NAME - (PRIMARY TRIGGER) (SECONDARY TRIGGER) (SECONDARY TRIGGER) (ETC)


## Spells

### Spells vs. Skills
Spells are Skills, but not all Skills are Spells. Functionally, Spell cost is exactly the same as a normal Skill. A Spell is denoted with a (spell) Secondary Trigger label.

Actors must have at least 1 point in Mentality to cast spells.

#### Offensive Spells
When an actor gains their first point in Mentality, they gain an offensive spell. Offensive spells may only gain benefits from Skills that are Spells. 

Casting an offensive spell has the same cost and requirements as a regular attack. Stats for the base Offensive Spell are listed in the Equipment Sheet.

#### Utility Spells
Utility Spells are spells that do not deal damage directly. Casting a utility spell has the same cost and requirement as using a Skill.

#### Mentality Spell Cost Reduction
For each point an Actor has in Mentality, their spell cost is reduced by 1, with the minimum cost being 1. 

Example: “You cast an Offensive Spell and want to apply a Spell Skill to it. The cost of casting a Spell is 1 Major action and the cost of the Spell Skill is 1 Major Action or 1 SP. You have 1 point in Mentality so your spell’s total cost is reduced by 1, making the additional Spell Skill free to use. You then wish to cast an offensive spell using 2 Spell skills. The spell will cost 1 Major action and an additional Major action or 1 SP after the spell cost reduction.”


## Putting it All Together

Now that we have a familiarity with the core rules let’s bring everything together in an example scenario.

For this scenario we will have 3 players fighting 3 enemies. The Scenario will be narrated from the GM’s and Player’s perspective. The scenario starts just after turn order has been decided and Actor tokens are on the battlefield.

GM: Josh, you go first. What would you like to do?
Josh: Hmm, well, the sides are pretty even seeing as its 3 on 3. I think I will take out my longbow and start shooting the enemies. Seems a little safer at the moment.
GM: Ok, so pulling out your bow will require a Minor Action. Which enemy would you like to attack first?
Josh: I think I will shoot the one furthest away first.
GM: Let’s see, he is 1, 2, 3, 4 Short distances away from you. What is the range on your longbow?
Josh: Shoot, It has a max range of Long so I will take a penalty if I make that attack, right?
GM: Yes, you would apply disadvantage for that ranged attack. There are closer targets, though.
Josh: Yup, I am going to shoot the second furthest target which is at Long range.
GM: Alright, go ahead and roll a Basic Roll for that attack and don’t forget to add your Finesse to the attack.
{Josh rolls a Basic Roll and gets 4, 5 and another 5 (14)}
Josh: Nice! I got a 14. The total is 15 with my bonus to ranged attacks from my 1 point in Finesse. Does that hit?
{GM rolls evasion for the targeted actor}
GM: The enemy rolled an 8 for their Evasion so you hit. Roll your damage and let's see what the defense is.
{Josh rolls a 3}
Josh: My longbow does 1d6+3, I rolled a 3 so that is 6 damage.
GM: Does your attack also have Pierce?
Josh: Whoops, yes it has 2 pierce.
GM: So, 6 damage and 2 pierce. Well even with the Pierce, your damage is completely absorbed by the armor. Would you like to attack again?
Josh: Woah, it must have been some strong armor. Uh, ya I will attack the same target again, but I am going to use my Piercing Strike Skill. It says the triggers are on attack and ranged, so I can use that right?
GM: Yup. Are you going to use SP or another Major Action to use that Skill?
Josh: I am going to use a Major Action, I want to have SP in case something bad happens outside of my turn.
{Josh rolls 3, 6, and another 6 (15)}
Josh: Woo hoo! That’s a total of 16 with my bonus! That’s gotta hit right?
GM: It hits! The Evasion was also a 16, you are lucky you have a point in Finesse. Go ahead and roll damage.
Josh: Ok. I rolled a 6! 9 damage! Oh, and it pierces for 2!
GM: Didn’t you use the Piercing strike skill, as well?
Josh: Wow, I am just trying to lose, apparently. It says add 1d6 pierce to your attack for each point in finesse. So I rolled 1d6… and I got a 3. So 9 damage and 5 pierce.
GM: Alright, the enemy didn’t roll as well for defense this time, so your pierce completely negates his armor. You deal all of your damage.
Josh: Not bad. Since I have no more actions, I will end my turn.
GM: Ok, Monica, it is your turn.
Monica: Alright, I want to draw my longsword and move closer to the enemies. That’s a Minor Action to draw a weapon, I want to move 1, 2 short distances, so that’s 2 Major Actions.
GM: Someone’s prepared. You draw your sword and move a Medium distance closer to the enemy. You still have a Major Action left.
GM: Hmm, I think I will let them come to me. I will raise my shield, which I was already holding, and that’s my last Major Action since I already used my Minor Action to draw my sword.
GM: Alrighty, that was a quick turn. It is now the first enemy's turn. Monica, it seems like your plan worked. The enemy moves into your zone and Engages with you. They used all of their actions to get there, so it looks like you are going to have the first opportunity to strike. Taylor, you are up next.
Taylor: Yes, alright. Monica looks like she is about to be Outnumbered so I want to cast a Charm Spell on her to give her some extra juice.
GM: Ok, so Charm is tied to your base Spell range, which has a max of Close range. Monica is a medium distance away from you.
Taylor: Ok, I will draw my wand to extend my max spell range to Short, and then move a Short distance. Now I am close enough to use Charm. Monica, you get +1 to attack and damage rolls until my next turn starts.
Monica: Much appreciated! Thanks Taylor.
GM: Ok, you still have 1 Major Action left, Taylor. What do you want to do?
Taylor: I am going to cast a Minion spell. It says that I can add a bonus to it for each point in mentality, so I am gonna give it some armor. It’s tier 1 armor, right?
GM: Yes, so that's 1d6 for defense rolls.
Taylor: Cool. My minion has one Major Action, so I am going to move it into Monica’s zone and use its 1 minor action to Engage with her to help her fight. And that is all for my turn.
GM: Ok, good preparation. It is the second enemy's turn now. They draw a crossbow, load it and shoot at you Taylor. You apparently spooked the enemies.
Taylor: Shoot, uh, I am going to use my SP to cast Energy Shield and give myself some extra cushion.
GM: Ok. Is that skill triggered by being targeted at range?
Taylor: It says “anytime” and “spell”. That’s it.
GM: Alright you Cast Energy Shield. And its a good thing you did, the enemy rolled an Automatic Success on their attack. Roll your Evasion to see if it scores a crit.
Taylor: Please, be a good roll… uh, I got a 10 for my evasion. Does it crit me?
GM: Yes, It rolled a total of 19. That is within the Critical Threshold. Go ahead and roll your Defense.
Taylor: Well, I rolled a 6, so 6 for my defense.
GM: ALright, the attack has Pierce 4, and you take… 13 damage. Are you good?
Taylor: Barely, I took 11 and I have 13 HP, so, ouch.
GM: Don’t forget your Energy Shield.
Taylor: Oh, right. so, it absorbed 2 damage. So I took 9 damage.
GM: That’s a little better. The enemy uses their last action to reload their crossbow. And now the third enemy moves to Engage with Monica and the others. It still has 1 Major Action left when it gets there. So it is going to attack both Monica and Taylor’s minion using the Overswing skill. Monica, Roll evasion, and Taylor, roll for your minion.
Taylor: Oof, I rolled 5 for my minion.
Monica: I rolled 13 and added 1 because I am blocking. So, 14.
GM: The enemy rolls a 16, so it scores a crit on the minion, and regular damage to Monica.
Taylor: Well, good thing I can summon another one.
GM: Monica, you take 7 damage, and the minion takes another 5 on top of that. Roll your defense.
Monica: I rolled a 3, and my tier 2 armor is 1d6+3, so 6. I take 1.
Taylor, I rolled a 1 so my minion dies. Sorry, Monica. Looks like you are on your own for a bit.
GM: Josh, you are up.
Josh: Ok, so I want to shoot the guy who just killed Taylor’s minion.
GM: you are firing into an engagement with allies, so you will be disadvantaged for that attack.
Josh: I am going to use my Thread the Needle skill to remove the penalty.
GM: You will not be disadvantaged for this attack. Go ahead and roll.
Josh: Ok, I got a total of 14.
GM: You hit, go ahead and roll for damage.
Josh: I rolled 5, so that's 8 damage with 2 pierce.
GM: Nice. You break through all its armor and deal all 8 damage.
Josh: Woot! Ok, I am going to make an attack against the crossbow guy. Oh, he’s at Long + 1. I am going to use my SP to use the Longshot Skill. It increases my range and adds damage if I hit at my max range.
GM: Ok, go ahead and roll.
Josh: I got a 17.
GM: You crit. Roll your damage.
Josh: I get an extra critical damage dice from Finesse, so that's 2d6+3, and I get 1 more damage from Longshot, and Pierce 2, so that's, oh man, 5 plus 6 plus 3 plus 1, so 15 damage with 2 pierce?
GM: That checks out. This enemy isn’t wearing armor so it takes 15 damage and dies. Nice job.
Josh: That’s how its done! Ok, so I am done with my turn.
GM: Monica?
Monica: Alright, I am going to use Overswing on this next attack. I want to hit the enemy that killed Taylor’s minion.
GM: Go ahead.
Monica: Nice, I got a 14 total.
GM: Alright you hit, roll damage.
Monica: So I roll 2d6 from my weapon, add 1d6, and add 1 from Vigor and 1 more from Overswing, And I rolled… 16! And add 2 for 18 damage total.
GM: It rolls pretty well for its defense and absorbs 9 damage, taking 9 total. It also uses the Retreat skill to disengage.
Monica: Great, I use Step up and reengage with this loser.
GM: Alright, it is visibility shaking and prepared to die.
Monica: I attack for 12 total.
GM: It rolled 11 for Evasion.
Monica: 8 more damage?
GM: That does it. It only rolled 3 for its defense and takes 5 damage. That's enough to drop it.
Monica: And that’s my turn. Only one left.
GM: The first enemy goes for you, Josh. It moves two short distances, engages you, and attacks.
Josh: Dang, should have held on to my SP last turn. I rolled a 11 for my Evasion.
GM: It also rolls 11, so you take 7 damage.
Josh: Not wearing any armor so I take 7 damage.
GM: Taylor?
Taylor: I am going to move into Josh’s zone, engage and use my free hand to cast a Melee Offensive Spell.
GM: Yup, sounds good. Go ahead and roll.
Taylor: Ok, I roll, oh, 7.
GM: Well, it is disadvantaged on Evasion since it is Outnumbered, but it got an 8, so that’s a miss.
Taylor: I attack again, for 13 this time.
GM: You hit, and deal a critical. It got a 3 total. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taylor: Yes, I rolled 11 damage.
GM: It rolled 6 defense, but that’s reduced by half since its a spell. It takes 8 damage. You have one more Major Action left.
Taylor: I attack again, and roll a 13 again.
GM: You hit again as well.
Taylor: 5 damage this time?
GM: That does it, It only had 1 HP left. You have won this combat.
