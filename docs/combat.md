Combat
Before Combat Starts
There are a number of things that need to happen before combat starts
Battlefield
A battlefield must be created in order for actors to move about and interact with each other and consists of any number of Zones that connect in some way.
Zones
Zones are a representation of an area that can contain several actors and multiple engagements. Zones do not have a predetermined size or shape in game but are typically represented as squares for the players.
Creating the Battlefield
There are several different ways to create a battlefield. The only requirement is that the battlefield has at least one zone. It is currently recommended to have a battlefield of 3x3 to 5x5. The battlefield can be drawn on a sheet of paper, a white board, or in dirt. A battlefield could consist of connecting popsicle sticks, string, or sticky notes. It really does not matter how you represent your battlefield as long as the zones are clearly defined and connected in some manner.

For a dynamic battlefield use a deck of cards. Before creating the battlefield, select a type of card to represent different terrains and zones matching that card type represent the chosen terrain.
> The GM wishes to create a battlefield in a forested area. Before laying down the cards they decide face cards count as zones with cover and concealment and aces are zones with difficult terrain.

Once you have created your battlefield, determine turn order.
Turn Order
Once a battlefield is created, determine the turn order of all actors. You can do this by rolling dice (preferably 20-sided as 3d6 tends to require more rolls to break ties), guessing a number, drawing straws, or drawing cards from a deck. It does not matter how you determine turn order.

Once turn order is determined, actors must decide which zone they want to start their turn in.
Changing Turn Order
Actors may opt to change their turn order once per combat. To change orders an actor must make the decision at the beginning of their turn before any actions are used. That actor then chooses a new position in the turn order and waits until their new turn order appears before they can act.
Placing Actors on the Battlefield
Once turn order is decided, determine where actors will start their turn on the battlefield. You can use figurines, coins, tokens, thumbtacks, or anything that can help distinguish one player from another. Several tokens should be able to fit in one zone. Generally, opposing groups should be placed on opposite sides of the battlefield, but tokens can be placed in any manner that makes sense.
Flow of Combat
The flow of combat is determined by rounds and turns, turns being each individual actor's set of actions in turn order, and a round being a completion of all actors' turns.
Actions
Each actor starts a turn with 3 Major actions and 1 Minor actions. Depending on certain circumstances these numbers may change at the start of a turn. Actions can only be used during an actor's turn. Once an actor has used all actions their turn is over. Actors may also end their turn without using all of their actions. Any actions remaining at the early end of a turn are lost.
Skill Points (SP)
Skill points can be used during an actors turn or outside of an actors turn so long as the skill trigger is satisfied (i.e. On Hit and Anytime triggers can be used outside of the actor’s turn).
Attacking and Evading
Attacking and evading are opposed rolls to determine when an actor is hit by another actor’s attack.
Declaring a Target
When an actor is at the correct range to attack an actor they must declare an actor as the target. This is to satisfy certain skill triggers. Once skills are used or if no skills are used, the actor makes their attack.
Attacking and Evading
Once a target is declared and Targeted skills are used, the attacker must now decide to use any On Attack skills before rolling their dice. The attacker then rolls for their attack. Roll 3d6 and adjust the dice values if edge, pressure, advantage, or disadvantage apply. Calculate any bonuses or penalties to the attack roll to determine the total.
> The attacker makes a regular attack with a +1 bonus and applies edge to their roll. They roll a 2, 4, and 5. The 5 is adjusted to a 6 (applying edge) which makes the final roll a 2, 4, and 6. The roll is a 12 and the +1 bonus is applied for a total of 13.

The defender may roll their evasion roll once they have been targeted and have used any skills with the Targeted trigger. They do not need to wait for the attack roll total before rolling. The evasion roll is determined in the same manner that an attack roll is, roll 3d6, adjust the die values, and add any bonuses or penalties.

An attack hits if the attack roll total was Greater Than OR Equal To the evasion roll.
Damage and Defense
When an attack hits, the attacker rolls to see how much damage they do. There are two main damage types to consider:
Base Damage: Damage calculated from any rolled dice based on the values they show
Bonus Damage: Damage calculated from Attributes, skills or weapons shown as +X or -X
> A longsword shows its damage as 1d6+3 and an actor gains +1 damage to melee damage from Vigor. The base damage is 1d6 and the bonus damage is +4.

When an attack hits, the defender uses their armor’s Base Defense and any bonuses or penalties to see how much damage they ignore. There are two main defense types to consider:
Base Defense: Defense calculated from the Base Defense value of an armor
Bonus Defense: Defense calculated from Attributes, skills or shields shown as +X or -X
Determining Damage Reduction
Lets use the longsword example from above and assume the attacker hits with a regular attack and rolls a base damage of 3 (1d6) and adds +4 bonus damage. The defender is wearing armor with a Base Defense of 3, 4 and has a +1 bonus defense from Vigor. The Base Defense of an armor determines which Base Damage dice values are ignored from damage rolls. The attack does no base damage (ignored by the Base Defense value of the armor) and +3 bonus damage (reduced by 1 from Bonus Defense) so the total damage dealt from the attack is 3. If the damage roll had a base damage of 5 instead of 3, the armor would not have ignored that value and the attack would have done 8 damage instead (5 + 4 - 1).

In a situation where all damage is blocked, that attack does 1 damage instead. 1 is the Minimum Damage that is dealt from an attack that hits and is never less than 1.

Once damage is dealt, the defender may use any On Hit trigger skills. Then reduce their total HP by the damage dealt.
HP Between Different Combats
Depending on the style of play, determine how HP is recovered (or not) between combats. It doesn’t really matter how you choose to do this so long as everyone agrees on how HP is handled between combats. HP between combats can:
Recover to full amount
Not recover any amount
Only recover to a max of half Total HP
Recover based on level and attributes
Dropping Below 0 HP
Once an actor’s HP drops below 0 they can no longer act in that combat, meaning they do not get a turn and cannot use skills or actions. Depending on the style of play, what happens when an actor’s HP drops below 0 is up to the group, meaning that a character could die (make a new character) or could simply be knocked out or disabled until the end of the combat.
