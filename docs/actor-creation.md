Actor Creation
Actors in Shaper refers to any play or non-player character on the battlefield. All actors are created using this method.
Creating your actor
Write down a name for your Actor. Write down the Player’s name if necessary.
Determine your level.
Distribute your Attribute points.
Distribute your Skills.
Determine your total HP.
Determine your SP.
Choose your armor and weapons.
Determine your evasion.
Double check all your stats are correct.
Name your Actor
This should be self explanatory. If your actor does not need a name, then give a brief description of your Actor (i.e. goblin).
Determine your Level
At level 1 all actors receive:
1 Attribute point
1 Skill
10 base HP
1 total SP
1 SP regen
Starting equipment

Every level after 1st, actors receive:
1 Skill

At level 5 and every 5 levels after, actors receive:
1 Attribute point
+1 to total SP

At level 10 and every 10 levels after, actors receive:
+1 to SP regen
Distribute your Attributes
Attributes determine how your actor approaches combat. They are as follows:
Vigor
Vigor is a measure of your actor’s raw strength, endurance, and vitality. Actors with high Vigor can wear more protective armor and deal more damage in melee combat. Vigor skills help control the flow of action on the battlefield and can make an actor extremely dangerous up close.

For every point invested in Vigor, an actor gets:
+1 to Melee attack rolls
+1 to physical Melee bonus damage and physical Thrown bonus damage
+1 to bonus defense
Finesse
Finesse is a measure of your actor’s raw dexterity, precision, and talent. Actors with high Finesse are difficult to hit, and can hit enemies more consistently with Ranged attacks. Finesse skills allow for high mobility on the battlefield, punching through tough armor, and dealing devastating criticals.

For every point invested in Finesse, an actor gets:
+1 to Evasion rolls
+1 to Ranged and Thrown attack rolls
+1 critical damage die
Mentality
Mentality is a measure of your actor’s raw intellect, awareness, and reason. Actors with high Mentality gain access to offensive, defensive, and utility spells. Mentality skills can morph your attack spells to suit specific situations, buff and debuff other actors, and control minions to aid you in combat.

For every point invested in Mentality, an actor gets:
+1 to attack Spell damage
Reduce spell damage by 2
Gain 1 additional Skill of your choosing
Distribute your Skills
In order to gain access to a Skill you must have at least 1 point invested in its relevant Attribute, with the exception of General Skills which have no requirements.

Each skill can be invested in up to 4 times. Once you have maxed out a skill, you gain access to its mastery. Masteries can give passive bonuses, change the effect of the skill, or allow you to use a more powerful version of that skill for a higher cost.

The strength and magnitude of skills are increased by their relevant Attribute. The amount of points invested in a Skill determines how many times you can use a Skill in a single round of combat.

Skills also determine how much your actor’s total HP is. Whenever you gain access or invest points into a Skill you gain HP depending on the type of skill it is:
Vigor = 4 HP
General = 3 HP
Finesse & Mentality = 2 HP
Determine your HP
10 (base) + 4 x Vigor skills + 3 x General skills + 2 x Finesse skills + 2 x Mentality skills = TOTAL HP
Determine your SP
1 (base) + Actor level / 5 = TOTALSP

1 (base) + Actor Level / 10 = SP REGEN
Choose your Armor & Weapons
New actors should start with 1 set of armor and 3 weapons or 2 weapons and 1 shield.
Armor
Armor helps protect your actor from damage if they are hit. Armor is rated by tiers that range from 0 to 5, 0 being the least protection, 5 being the most. Armors may also restrict your mobility by reducing your Evasion bonus or by losing your move action every turn. 
Shields
Shields offer a variety of benefits depending on which type you choose:
Light shields - +1 to parry attempts
Medium shields - +1 bonus to Evasion
Heavy shields - +1 bonus defense
Keep in mind, these benefits are only applied if your actor uses the Block action before the end of their turn.
Weapons
Weapons are divided into several categories ranging from light to heavy. The stats and properties of a weapon depend on its type, where light weapons do the least damage and have the shortest range while heavy weapons do the most damage and have the longest range.

It is not necessary to keep track of ammo for ranged weapons currently. However, players should keep track of thrown weapons.
Determine your Evasion
Each actor has a base Evasion of 3d6. Any bonuses or reductions to Evasion are added or subtracted to the total of the base Evasion roll. Calculate this bonus by adding or subtracting any bonuses or reductions from Finesse, Skill masteries, and Armor.
Double Check your Sheet
The last step is to double check your Actor Sheet to make sure all of the numbers you have written down are correct and you are using the correct gear and skills that you want to use.
