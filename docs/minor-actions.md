Minor Actions
Minor actions represent quick actions that don’t happen as frequently as Major actions. Actors have 1 Minor action to use during their turn. Actors cannot use minor actions outside of their turn (i.e. during another actor's turn). Actors may also use a Major action as a Minor action if they have already used their Minor action during their turn.
Types of Minor Actions
Engaging or disengaging
Block
Parry
Ready a weapon
Switch weapon grip
Pick up an item
Interact with an item or object
Engaging or Disengaging
Engaging or Disengaging with actors or a group of actors requires a minor action to perform.
Special Cases
Engaging and disengaging with friendly actors
Allied actors may create an engagement together. Doing so requires a Minor action, but if any allied player wishes to leave an allied engagement (with no hostile actors involved in that engagement) then they may do so as a free action.
Allied Engagement
Allied actors may wish to engage targets together. When two or more allied actors are engaged with the same hostile actor, they are already in an Allied Engagement. Allied actors engage each other in a similar manner to engaging with a hostile actor. If the hostile actor disengages from those players their Allied Engagement is still in place. Two things can happen from this point:
An actor may leave the Allied at no cost (Free action) and continue the encounter on their own
Actors in an allied engagement may move together as a unit.

An actor may move the entire Allied Engagement (including themselves) during their turn to any point they can reach without using skills. Other players that are moved by an allied actor start their turn without the actions used by the actor that moved the Allied Engagement:
> An actor moves an allied engagement one short distance and engages with a hostile actor. Other actors in this Allied Engagement start their turn as if they have moved 1 short distance and engaged and only have 2 Major actions left for that turn.

Actors in the unit may also be “dropped off” to a zone that the leader moves through. This works the same as the scenario above but only count the movement of your character:
> You are moved by the engagement leader and decide you want to leave the engagement after 1 short distance. Your actor starts their turn with 1 Minor action and 2 Major actions.
The Block Action
The block action is used to put your Actor into a defensive posture. 
When you block you gain the benefit of any shield you are holding from the end of your turn until the beginning of your next turn.
The Parry Action
The parry action is similar to the block action but serves a different purpose. When taking the parry action you may attempt to interrupt one melee attack from any actor in your current engagement. A parry can be attempted after an actor has finalized their attack roll total and any on attack skills have been chosen. Roll an attack roll against an actor’s attack roll, if your attack roll is greater than the attacker’s roll, their attack fails and does not hit any targets. You must be engaged and have a weapon with melee range to parry. You cannot parry ranged attacks with this action. You may take this action multiple times before the end of your turn to gain more parry attempts outside of your turn. Any unused parry attempts are lost at the beginning of your next turn.
Ready a Weapon
Drawing or readying a weapon, as well as sheathing or stowing a weapon, requires a Minor action. 
Switch Weapon grip
When weapons have the versatile property, you must switch your Actor’s grip to use the alternate attack form of that weapon. This can also be used to free up a hand when using a two handed weapon, allowing you to pick up an item or hold another weapon in your free hand. Actors cannot make attacks with two handed weapons held this way and must switch grips again to properly hold the weapon.
Pick up an item
Minor actions may be used to pick up an item that is directly next to you (i.e. an item you just dropped). In order to pick up an item, it must be unattended (not held or carried by an Actor), be easily retrieved with one hand (no very small items {like a gemstone} or very big items {like a suit of armor}), have a free hand, and not be in an engagement
Interact with an Item or Object
Throwing a switch, breaking a window, giving a command or instructions (different than speaking) or uncorking a potion are all examples of using a Minor action for interaction.
